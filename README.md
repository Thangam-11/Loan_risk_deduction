# Financial Loan Risk Default Prediction:

Introduction:

This project addresses the challenges faced by lending institutions in assessing creditworthiness and predicting loan defaults. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to develop models that accurately predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. These models can assist lending institutions in making informed decisions about loan approvals, thus reducing the risk of financial losses due to defaults.

*Data Preprocessing:*

The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of financial loan applications, with each represented by a unique identification number (SK_ID_CURR). The primary target variable, TARGET, indicates whether the applicant defaulted on the loan (1) or not (0), crucial for assessing credit risk. Several key features aid in assessing creditworthiness, including personal demographics, financial status, employment details, housing situation, educational background, and family status. These attributes provide valuable context for evaluating an applicant's financial stability and ability to repay a loan.
