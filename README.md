# Financial Loan Risk Default Prediction:

*Introduction:*

This project aims to address the challenges faced by lending institutions in assessing creditworthiness and predicting loan defaults. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to develop models that can accurately predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. These models can help lending institutions make informed decisions about loan approvals, reducing the risk of financial losses due to defaults.

Data Preprocessing: 


Data Understanding ;
The dataset at hand provides a comprehensive overview of financial loan applications, each represented by a unique identification number (SK_ID_CURR). The primary target variable, TARGET, denotes whether the applicant defaulted on the loan (1) or not (0), making it a crucial factor in assessing credit risk.Several key features are included to aid in assessing an applicant's creditworthiness. These features encompass various aspects such as personal demographics (CODE_GENDER, FLAG_OWN_CAR, FLAG_OWN_REALTY), financial status (AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, AMT_CREDIT, AMT_ANNUITY), employment details (NAME_INCOME_TYPE, OCCUPATION_TYPE, DAYS_EMPLOYED),housing situation (NAME_HOUSING_TYPE, REGION_POPULATION_RELATIVE), educational background (NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE), and family status (CNT_CHILDREN, CNT_FAM_MEMBERS). These attributes can offer valuable context in evaluating an applicant's financial stability and ability to repay a loan.
