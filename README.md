# Financial Loan Risk Default Prediction:

*Introduction:*

This project aims to address the challenges faced by lending institutions in assessing creditworthiness and predicting loan defaults. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to develop models that can accurately predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. These models can help lending institutions make informed decisions about loan approvals, reducing the risk of financial losses due to defaults.
